  <h3>What is AoC?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><code><strong><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a></strong></code> is an Advent calendar of <strong>small programming puzzles</strong> for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.</li>
    <li>Participating in these yearly puzzles can increase one's proficiency as an existing programmer, as well as inspire and assist new programmers on their steep learning curve.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Cheating is by no means promoted or advised. Fellow programmers are encouraged to partake in the annual Advent of Code legitimately, in order to grow their array of skills and expand their knowledge, or simply to challenge themselves and have fun. Attaining the solution through such unethical means as copying code (without comprehending the code itself and applying it) will subsequently stunt one's growth, being detrimental to their prosperity in the long run.</li>
  </ul>
